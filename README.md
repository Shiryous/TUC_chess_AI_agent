<H1> TUC Chess AI agent</H1>
This repository holds the enviroment and the agent that was developed for the purposes of the course "Artificial Intelligence" during the 2022 year. 

The chess game environment was provided is not conventional chess, it uses the dimensions of 6x8 it generates random prizes, has special rules, such as time restriction per move.

The agent is implemented in Java, it uses 2 different approaches for the game playing logic. 

The first one is an approach using the Min Max algorithm with an extension of alpha beta pruning, to accelerate the searching of the nodes.

The second game playing logic was created by implementing the algorithm of Monte Carlo Tree search with an Upper Confidence bound.
